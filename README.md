<h2>Stock Market Analysis Project:</h2>

Using the Jupyter notebook, I imported historic stock data for Tesla, General Motors and Ford. 


I would disect/clean the data using pandas and perform various calculations to further engineer and analyse data.

Using this data I would then plot it using various tools available in the matplotlib package, this would allow the user to clearly gauge volatility and price action of each stock comparatively.

The stocks were also compared for correlation and using mplfinance a candlestick chart was plot for Ford for Jan-2012.

This Github Repository contains:
- The Jupyter Notebook file.
- A .pdf conversion of the notebook file.
- the original stock data .csv's
